# Artificial Intelligence - Project

This is a frontend project for the Artificial Intelligence course.  
It consists of 2 parts.  
The first part displays search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Branch And Bound, A*).  
The second part is a game that demonstrates the functioning of algorithms for turn-based games (Minimax, Alpha Beta Pruning, Expectimax, Max^n).

This frontend communicates with the backend, which processes the map using the mentioned algorithms and returns the next move.

Technologies:
- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
