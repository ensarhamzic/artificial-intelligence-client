# Artificial Intelligence - Project

This is a frontend project for the Artificial Intelligence course.  
It consists of 2 parts.  
The first part displays search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Branch And Bound, A*).  
The second part is a game that demonstrates the functioning of algorithms for turn-based games (Minimax, Alpha Beta Pruning, Expectimax, Max^n).

This frontend communicates with the backend, which processes the map using the mentioned algorithms and returns the next move.

Technologies:
- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

# Instructions

First part:
1. Choose an agent of your choice (each agent uses a different search algorithm - click on the ! next to the agent selection section to see the algorithm used by each).
2. Select the map size.
3. Choose the material for each field on the map (each material has a different cost - click on the ! next to the materials section to see the cost of each).
4. Use the Drag and Drop gesture to place the agent at the desired starting position.
5. Use the Drag and Drop gesture to place the target X at the desired position.
6. Press the Spacebar on the keyboard to let the agent calculate the path and start moving along it.
